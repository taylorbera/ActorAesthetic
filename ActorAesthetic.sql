('Why Should I Join Actors\' Equity?', 'Actors\' Equity Association (AEA) is the performing arts union representing more than 51,000 professional stage actors and stage managers in the United States. Equity provides a wide range of benefits by negotiating wages, working conditions, and providing health and pension plans for its members. ', 'whyjoinequity.jpeg', 'WHO RUNS ACTORS’ EQUITY?\r\n\r\nAs a representative democracy, Equity is governed by members, for members. Its chief policy-making and governing body, the National Council, is elected by the membership and composed of working actors and stage managers. Equity Officers and Councillors serve without compensation.\r\n\r\nHOW CAN I JOIN ACTORS’ EQUITY?\r\n\r\nActors may join the Association by virtue of employment under an Equity contract, by virtue of prior membership in a performing arts sister union (SAG-AFTRA, AGMA, AGVA or GIAA) or through the Equity Membership Program.\r\n\r\nDeciding when to join the union is up to you and your prerogative. However, once you become a member of the union, you are entitled to two categories of benefits: Contract Benefits and Membership Benefits.\r\n\r\nAEA CONTRACT BENEFITS\r\n\r\nEquity has fought time and again for the dignity of the performer. Prior to the stage union, most actors worked without contract or security of any kind. Today, the union works diligently to negotiate contract rates, minimum salaries, ensure overtime pay and extra pay for additional duties. Free Housing is always provided on contract, and per diem is included on tour. \r\n\r\nEquity also requires most producers to post a bond to ensure payment; even if a show closes or a producer defaults, you still get paid and won’t get stranded.\r\n\r\nStrict work rules are enforced on all Equity contracts, including length of day, breaks in between rehearsal periods, days off, and safe and sanitary conditions.\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise noted, most Equity contracts provide Health Insurance, Pension and 401(k). Hospital and medical benefits are provided by CIGNA (Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, also known as the Medical Plan). Prescription drug benefits are provided by ProAct. An optical plan, administered by Davis Vision, provides eye coverage. Dental coverage is available to participants on a voluntary self-pay basis through CIGNA.\r\n\r\nAnd if you are ever injured on the job, Supplemental Workers\' Comp Insurance provides additional compensation over-and-above Workers\' Comp.\r\n\r\nAEA MEMBERSHIP BENEFITS\r\n\r\nEquity ensures Professional Name Protection, prohibiting the issuing of a professional name that is identical (or similar sounding) to that of an already-current member of the union.\r\n\r\nTax assistance is provided through Volunteer Income Tax Assistance. The VITA Program prepares and files your tax returns when you are seen – on an appointment or walk-in basis.\r\n\r\nMember Discounts include classes, workshops, fitness centers and gyms, hotels and restaurants, salons and spas, studios and rehearsal spaces, subscriptions and tickets, etc. \r\n\r\nSeminars and Special Events on the business of Broadway, taxes, producing, and more are held throughout the year for Equity members. Free flu shots are regularly administered.\r\n\r\nEquity members have auditions access to over a thousand auditions per year. Equity has negotiated required auditions for principal and chorus performers. More than 1,300 audition notices are posted on Equity’s website annually. Equity’s Casting Call, accessed through the Member Portal website, is focused on accessibility and signing up for auditions with ease. For members on the road, members out of town or even for those sitting at home, Casting Call is a member feature that is dedicated to making searching for a job a lot easier. Not only are you able to sign up for Equity Chorus Calls and Equity Principal auditions, but you have the option to save notices you’re interested in and add upcoming auditions directly to your calendar.\r\n\r\nEquity sets terms and regulations for agents that protect our members and standardizes conditions such as a commission schedule, termination agreements and more.\r\n\r\nMembers receive access to the Equity News magazine, the official magazine of Actors\' Equity Association. Currently published quarterly, Equity News has been around in a variety of formats since 1915.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL BENEFITS\r\n\r\nUnion membership also includes access to service organizations like The Actors Fund, Actors Federal Credit Union, Union Plus and AFL-CIO. These organizations offer a host of additional resources such as emergency assistance, seminars, career counseling, low cost financial services, loans and discounts.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important benefits of Equity membership that is often overlooked is the experience and knowledge of the Equity staff. Equity\'s Business Representatives enforce each member\'s individual contract provisions and riders. They monitor safety conditions, administer Equity\'s agreements with franchised agents and assist members with work-related issues like unemployment and Workers\' Compensation claims.\r\n\r\nEquity\'s staff is dedicated to preserving the integrity of the Principal, Chorus and Stage Managers\' contracts. Members should call the nearest Equity office and speak to a staff person whenever questions arise.\r\n', 'equity', '2018-10-26 15:30:00'),
('Equity Principal Auditions for Newbies', 'Everything you need to know about EPAs.', 'equityroom.jpeg', 'New to New York City? Want to get your foot in the door but don’t know where to start? Allow me to introduce you to the Equity Principal Audition. \r\n\r\nActors Equity Association, the union representing 51,000 stage actors and stage managers, provides a wide range of benefits for its members. One of the most important bonuses includes auditions run by the union. Equity Principal Auditions and Equity Chorus Calls are required by the union for any production or theatre that is run under an Equity contract.\r\n\r\nSO, WHAT\'S AN EQUITY PRINCIPAL AUDITION?\r\n\r\nOtherwise known as EPAs, Equity Principal Auditions are casting calls for leading and featured roles in a production or season of productions. Though they are technically auditions for lead characters, you may be considered for any role. \r\n\r\nThese auditions are required by the union for any production or theatre that is run under an Equity contract.\r\n\r\nCAN I GO TO AN EPA IF I AM NON-EQUITY?\r\n\r\nAccording to Actors\' Equity, \"actors who are not members of Equity are welcome to attend Equity auditions as our guests, provided that the casting personnel at the audition are willing to see non-Equity actors at that audition. There is never any guarantee that any non-Equity actors will be seen at an Equity audition.\"\r\n\r\nWILL AN EQUITY MONITOR BE AT EVERY EPA?\r\n\r\nAn Equity monitor will be present only at principal auditions that are being run according to these EPA procedures in New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles. When principal auditions are not required by Equity, the producer may choose to utilize these procedures after consultation with Equity. \r\n\r\nHOW DO I SIGN UP FOR AN EPA?\r\n\r\nEquity members can sign up online through the Equity Portal beginning one week before the audition. Four of the six appointments in each 20‐minute time slot will be available for online sign‐up. \r\n\r\nAEA members can also sign up the morning of the audition, starting one hour before the call. Two of the six appointments in each 20‐minute time slot will be available for in‐person sign‐up on the day of the EPA. If you choose to sign up the morning of the audition and you arrive before the call starts, you must wait in line in order of arrival with the other Equity members. The monitor arrives one hour before the audition to sign people in.\r\n\r\n*If the audition is at any other location besides Actors Equity Association, ask where the line ends so you can get in line properly.\r\n\r\nIf you are EMC,  you must sign up with the Equity Monitor on the EMC list before the midpoint of the scheduled EPA. When you sign up on time, your EMC privilege continues throughout the scheduled EPA. After the midpoint of the scheduled EPA, you may sign up on the regular non-Members list. To be signed up on the EMC list, you must present your own EMC card, signed in ink, to the Equity Monitor. \r\n\r\n*If the audition is at any other location besides Actors Equity Association, EMC members will line up amongst Equity members. Ask where the line ends so you can get in line properly.\r\n\r\nIf you are non-Equity, I suggest getting to the audition a few hours before to sign up on an unofficial list. Once the monitor arrives, you should make sure to transfer your name onto the official list.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF I’M NOT THERE WHEN THE MONITOR CALLS MY NAME?\r\n\r\nIf an Equity member is late or misses their scheduled appointment time, they are permitted to sign up for a new appointment (if appointment times are available) or sign up on Alternate List A.\r\n\r\nIf an Equity member misses their alternate slot, they may add their name to the end of the alternate list for another opportunity to be seen.\r\n\r\nIf you are EMC and you don\'t respond when the Monitor calls you to audition, your name must be crossed off the EMC list. If your name is crossed off, and you give your card to the Monitor again before the EPA reaches its scheduled midpoint, the Monitor will sign you up again at the bottom of the EMC list. If your name is crossed off, and you want to sign up again after the EPA has passed its scheduled midpoint (lunch break), please sign up at the bottom of the non-EMC non-Member list.\r\n\r\nIf you are non-Equity and you miss your name being called, you must signed up at the end of the non-Equity list.\r\n\r\nWHAT MATERIAL DO I NEED TO PREPARE FOR AN EPA?\r\n\r\nMost EPAs will ask for one 32-bar cut of a song or a short song in the style of the show (or season of shows). Some will ask for a 16-bar cut of a song and a one-minute monologue. Some may ask for a short monologue. Some may ask you to read from sides provided at the audition. \r\n\r\nBe sure to keep your audition under two minutes and always bring a headshot and resume.\r\n\r\n', 'equity', '2018-11-12 15:19:00'),
('What is the Monitor\'s Role At Auditions?', 'Audition monitors are people, too!', 'holdingRoom.jpeg', 'A monitor is a person either hired by the theatre or provided by Actors’ Equity Association to streamline the audition process for the casting team. These wonderful humans work hand-in-hand with producers and casting directors for the smooth flow of auditions.\r\n\r\nUnless the call is run by the casting director his or herself, you will most likely always have an audition monitor.\r\n\r\nAt an Equity audition, the monitor ensures that all rules governing audition procedures are followed.\r\n\r\nThe monitor sits at a table, usually in a “holding room” or just outside the audition room. He or she organizes of headshots, resumes, and any other audition-related materials. The monitor also keeps track of the order of which actors will go into the room to audition.\r\n\r\nHeads up to all my eager actor friends out there: monitors always pay attention to how actors behave. If the monitor has any affiliation with the theatre, he or she may find it appropriate to relay that information to the creative team.

('Actors\' Equity Announces New Enhancements to EPA Online Signups', 'AEA responds to members by making some much needed improvements.', 'equitydoor.jpeg', 'The staff at Actors’ Equity Association have announced that they are implementing new enhancements to Casting Call. As of November 19, 2018, these changes will improve system performance and give more insight into the online EPA signup process.\r\n\r\nBrandon Lorenz shared this message on Facebook to fellow Equity members.\r\n\r\n     We\'ve heard from Equity members about our EPA signups over the last year and staff has been working on it. If you tried to sign up for an EPA today, you might have noticed some changes. Read more here about what we\'ve done, and what other improvements are in the works.\r\n\r\nAccording to Equity, the changes include 1) a more consistent queueing experience, and 2) live user counts to let you know how many other members are using Casting Call and viewing today’s signups.\r\n\r\nWHAT’S DIFFERENT ABOUT EPA ONLINE SIGNUPS NOW?\r\n\r\nThe way you sign up for an EPA appointment online will be the same as before. However, processing time has been improved, ensuring a secure and consistent experience with the queue. \r\n\r\nQUEUE-MODE\r\n\r\nThe queue-mode is there to let you know what behavior to expect from the queue when you attempt to sign up online for an EPA. There are two different modes: Always-on and Safety-net.\r\n\r\n“ALWAYS-ON”\r\n\r\nThe queue will be turned to an “Always-on” mode during peak signup times (i.e., noon to 1pm in the Eastern time zone each day). This ensures that each user must go through the queue, even if the number of users on the portal has not yet surpassed the “busy” threshold.\r\n\r\n“SAFETYNET”\r\n\r\nSafetyNet mode is the default mode for the queue. Members will be added to the queue only if the number of members attempting to signup passes a certain threshold. \r\n\r\nLIVE USER COUNTS\r\n\r\nTo provide better insight into how busy the queue will be before you attempt to sign up at noon, Equity added live user counts throughout Casting Call.. There is also a count on the “Today’s EPA Signups” page including just those users viewing that page or any of today’s notices.\r\n\r\nPOST-SIGNUP\r\n\r\nIf you attempted to sign up for any EPA, Equity will be sending a post-signup email at the end of the rush period. This email will contain information and metrics on that day’s active signups and how busy it was during the noon rush period in the region where your EPA was located. \r\n\r\nIf you attempt to sign up for EPA appointments in more than one region in one day, you will receive multiple emails, one for each region. \r\n\r\nYou can opt out of these post-signup updates at any time.\r\n', 'equity', '2018-11-21 22:00:00'),
('5 Rookie Mistakes Prospective Students Make When Auditioning For College', 'Dissucssing what works, what doesn’t work, and how to get on top of your game during college auditions', 'collegeletters.jpeg', 'Are you in high school and interested in pursuing a degree in musical theatre? Chances are - you’ll need to audition.\r\n\r\nMost musical theatre college programs have required auditions for their major, especially if the degree is a BFA.\r\n\r\nBut don’t fret! I’m here to help.\r\n\r\nNot only did I successfully endure the unique process of musical theatre college auditions, I also watched my sister do the same a few years later. And on top of that, I sat in on on-campus auditions all four years at Texas State University. \r\n\r\nIt’s safe to say I have a pretty clear understanding of what works, what doesn’t work, and how to get on top of your game.\r\n\r\nHere are 5 rookie mistakes you’ll want to avoid when auditioning for colleges.\r\n\r\n1. PERFORMING MATERIAL THAT IS TOO OBSCURE.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to audition material, I know many of you are familiar with the dreaded term… “overdone.” You’ve done your research, you’ve read the musical theatre songs that flood the “do not sing” lists all over the internet. \r\n\r\nSO… instead of risking the chances of performing a popular song, you opt for the most obscure piece you can find.\r\n\r\nSometimes, there’s a reason why some songs are overdone. \r\n\r\nBut there’s also a reason why some songs are obscure.\r\n\r\nUse your better judgement. If the song is too obscure, the people behind the table will be focused more on the piece than your performance.\r\n\r\n2. CHOOSING A MONOLOGUE PLAGUED WITH CURSE WORDS.\r\n\r\nThink of it this way - if you feel uncomfortable performing your monologue in front of your family, you should probably toss it. Chances are, you’ll make the college professors uncomfortable too. \r\n\r\nWhy risk it? \r\n\r\nChoose a monologue that shows off your chops WITHOUT making them cringe.\r\n\r\nHow And Where To Find The Perfect Monologue\r\n\r\n3. NOT BRINGING A SECOND OUTFIT TO AUDITIONS.\r\n\r\nRain. Snow. Slipping in the mud. Bad weather.\r\n\r\nCoffee spills. Food. Rips. Tears. Ironing gone wrong. Shrinks in the wash. Accidents happen.\r\n\r\nBring a second outfit to all your auditions. You’ll thank me later.\r\n\r\n4. GOSSIPING WITH OTHERS OUTSIDE THE AUDITION ROOM.\r\n\r\nIf you have nothing nice to say, it’s better not to say anything at all. You never know who can hear you. \r\n\r\n(This is good practice for the rest of your career.)\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is stray away from any gossip about our industry. The Broadway show you\'re badmouthing might just be produced by the father of the head of the musical theatre department!\r\n\r\n5. LYING ON YOUR RESUME.\r\n\r\nDon’t lie about a professional show you were never in. Don’t lie about a role you never played. Don’t lie about a skill you don’t have. \r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nSometimes colleges only have a few minutes to spend with you in your audition to get to know you. After all, they might be spending the next four years of their lives with you! Besides the performance aspect of your audition, they may also ask you questions, and the perfect way to dig a little deeper is through your resume. They may ask you about a specific show, or role, or skill you have listed.\r\n\r\nInstead, focus on the experience you DO have.', 'college', '2020-05-23 20:17:00'),

But with statistics of something like 92% of the profession out of work at any given time, the chances of actually getting to perform are few and far between.\r\n\r\nMichael Simkins of The Guardian sums it up like this.\r\n\r\n\"The most common complaint about the acting game is that the profession is unfair. It isn\'t: but it is indifferent. It gives everything to some, and nothing to others, and it\'s not going to explain why. There\'s no point complaining: nobody\'s listening.\"\r\nWe get it.\r\n\r\nAnd we continue to fight the odds.\r\n\r\nHere\'s my question to you: based on these odds, if your life is solely defined by your work, are you really happy?\r\n\r\n1. REDEFINE HOW TO DRAW YOUR SELF-WORTH\r\n\r\nHey, self-doubt! Quit it!\r\n\r\nWhen pursuing acting as a career, dry spells in work aren’t just possible or probable; they’re inevitable and every actor has experienced them.  If you\'re basing your self-esteem entirely on how well your career is going, you\'re in for a very bumpy ride.\r\n\r\nYou are not your work. Separate yourself from the parts of your career that are out of your hands.\r\n\r\nEasier said than done, right?\r\n\r\nTry redefining your self-worth through the way you treat yourself and others. How would you like to be remembered?\r\n\r\n2. EXPLORE REFLECTIVE JOURNALING\r\n\r\nGive yourself 10-20 minutes each night before you go to bed to let it all out on paper. Reflect. What are you thankful for today? What made you laugh? What are you struggling with? Putting your emotions into words can lead to a deeper and more realistic view of your day.\r\n\r\nPutting pen to paper, (vs. typing on a keyboard) forces you to slow down and process your feelings.\r\n\r\n3. DISCOVER NEW CREATIVE OUTLETS\r\n\r\nExpress yo\'self!\r\n\r\nDo you like to write? Draw? Sketch? Design? Paint? Are you into photography? Graphic art? Playwriting? Blogging? Editing? Scrapbooking? Cooking? Do you write music? Poetry? Are you an avid reader? A gamer?\r\n\r\nIt is so important to exercise your creative mind in different ways other than acting.\r\n\r\nIsn\'t that how we grow as artists?\r\n\r\n4. GET YOURSELF SOME FRESH AIR\r\n\r\nTake a hike. Seriously. If it’s nice out, lay by the pool (a personal favorite of mine.) Do something that takes you outside for once... far, far away from harsh audition room florescent lighting and chilly theater buildings. Your heart, your mind, and your lungs, will thank you.\r\n\r\n(why are theaters always FREEZING?!)\r\n\r\n5. SURROUND YOURSELF WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE\r\n\r\nSurrounding yourself with people who have the same mind set as you; driven, hard working and with a healthy outlook on life, can have a great impact on your work ethic. \r\n\r\nYou are who choose to be with.

But when I lie in bed til noon, take a shower at 2 and finally get some food in my body by 3… I know I’ve already lost my day. \r\n\r\nDaylight is important for me because it’s when I get most of my work done.

PICK UP A HOBBY.\r\n\r\nRemember how much you loved that one hobby when you were a kid? Remember how happy it made you feel doing what you loved? \r\n\r\nFuel your creativity with something that falls outside of your career.\r\n\r\nNot sure quite what to do? Here’s a list!\r\n\r\nReading, writing, sketching, coloring, painting, blogging, hiking, running, walking, camping, fishing, antiquing, thrifting, cooking, baking, home brewing, mixology, sewing, photography, scrapbooking, calligraphy, quilting, knitting, embroidery, designing, pottery, jewelry making, wood carving, home improvement, trivia, video games, board games, chess, card games, puzzles, juggling, genealogy, journaling, language learning, writing music, playing instruments, podcasting, makeup, dancing, cosplaying, sculpting, sports, volunteering, graphic design, computer programing, Zumba, yoga, cycling\r\n\r\n3. MOVE YOUR BODY.\r\n\r\nLots of the hobbies I listed above involved moving your body.\r\n\r\nAnd I have my reasons!\r\n\r\nPersonally, walking (and coffee, of course) saved me in 2020. It cleared my mind every time I got my steps in.\r\n\r\nThe type of activity you decide to do doesn’t matter: dance in your bedroom with the lights off for all I care!

('10 Tips To Filming Your College Audition Prescreens Like A Pro', '10 Tips To Filming Your College Audition Prescreens Like A Pro. Here are 10 Tips To Filming Your College Audition Prescreens Like A Pro', 'filmingTips.png', 'So you want to pursue a degree in musical theatre, you’re ready to audition for college programs, and you realize you have to send in a prescreen.\r\n\r\nYou may be asking… what exactly is a prescreen?\r\n\r\nIn order to save time and money, many college programs require prescreen videos. These videos will help the faculty to decide whether or not you will be granted an “in-person” audition.\r\n\r\nPrescreens are video recordings of your audition pieces. Often, you will have to record yourself performing two contrasting songs, two contrasting monologues, and occasionally choreographed dance piece to evaluate your technique.\r\n\r\nHere’s how to film your college audition prescreens like a pro.\r\n\r\n1. NO NEED TO HIRE A PROFESSIONAL.\r\n\r\nMost students film prescreens on their own. A professional recording can be helpful, but in many cases - iPhone cameras work just as well. Technology is so good these days that it’s almost impossible to mess it up! However, if you would still like to go ahead and have a professional videographer film your self-tapes, then by all means WERK!\r\n\r\n2. PLAN OUT THE SHOOT.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have everything you possibly need to film and plan out the structure. One of the worst feelings in the world is to finish filming… only to realize you forgot an introduction video requirement or a monologue. \r\n\r\n3. APPLY AND REAPPLY MAKEUP.\r\n\r\nDepending on your lighting and location, the camera may pick up a shine on your face that’ll be distracting. Keep your makeup light and natural - a little goes a long way.\r\n\r\n4. PAY ATTENTION TO THE BACKGROUND, LIGHTING, AND SOUND BALANCE.\r\n\r\nThe background should be clean and simple. Try a plain wall with a neutral tone or a standard royal blue. Don’t have a blank wall? Not to worry! I highly suggest investing in this ePhotoInc Collapsible Backdrop.\r\n\r\nThe lighting should be bright enough to see your face clearly. Natural light is great - but if you can get your hands on a ring light, even better! The light from the ring light is crisp and with the right able, won’t bring any shadows onto your face.\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons, make sure to balance your sound appropriately. It is better for the music to be low so they can hear you than for it to overpower you.\r\n\r\n5. DOUBLE CHECK THE DIRECTIONS.\r\n\r\nEach college will inevitably ask for something different. It’s your job to stay on top of their requirements. I suggest making a spreadsheet to keep all your information in one place.\r\n\r\n6. KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIRECT-TO-CAMERA AND OFF-CAMERA FOCUS.\r\n\r\nThe general rule that you want to follow is that slates and any video introductions should be filmed looking directly into the camera lens; monologue and song material should be filmed with you looking slightly to the left or right of the camera. You would never deliver a monologue or song in a college audition using the audition panel as your scene partner, and the same rule applies to pre-screen filming.\r\n\r\n7. ESTABLISH YOUR PHYSICAL PARAMETERS BEFORE FILMING.\r\n\r\nYou want to stay in frame at all times, so if you’re moving at all in your audition material, make sure you know what your physical boundaries are to stay in frame. You’ll have to adjust slightly for the film medium. If you move out of frame or get too close to the camera, your brilliant take might not be usable.\r\n\r\n8. BE MINDFUL OF THE FRAMING SPECIFICS THAT EACH COLLEGE ASKS FOR.\r\n\r\nSome pre-screen schools want a mixture of “full body” and “waist up” shots.” Depending on your combination of pre-screen schools, this might require you to budget more time in your filming to readjust your framing.\r\n\r\n9. DON’T FORGET THE PRE-SCREEN SUPPLEMENTAL ESSAYS!\r\n\r\nSome programs may ask you to submit an additional arts-based supplemental essay or offer the possibility of sending an optional video. Programs wouldn’t ask you to complete these extra essays if they weren’t important; they use essays like this to get to know you better, to see how you write and think, and to measure your seriousness about the program.\r\n\r\n10. EDIT WITH CARE.\r\n\r\nUsing either iMovie or another video editing program, add a few transitions and titles to your video. \r\n\r\nFor example: Have a title screen at the beginning with your Name and Hometown. \r\n\r\nIf you have time, personalize it by listing what the audition is for under your name and home town. Don’t go too crazy with the edits… you want to show college programs exactly who you are and what you have to offer!\r\n', 'college', '2021-01-04 21:00:00'),

But lately… I’ve noticed one piece of unnecessary information that’s somehow made it to several young artists’ resumes.', 'maggie4', 'What exactly should actors list on their resumes?\r\n\r\nThe current industry standard is to include your name, contact information, credits, training, and any special skills you may have.\r\n\r\nBut lately… I’ve noticed one piece of unnecessary information that’s somehow made it to several young artists’ resumes.\r\n\r\nWeight.\r\n\r\nAnd this made me wonder… why should weight matter?\r\n\r\nWeight does not define you.\r\n\r\nA number on the scale should not determine which roles you play and what shows you’re cast in.\r\n\r\nAnd weight certainly doesn’t show up on any other type of resume.\r\n\r\nTherefore, weight has no business on an actor’s resume.\r\n\r\nI realized, after several conversations, that many young actors are still listing their weights because they’ve been told to. Trusted teachers, coaches and industry professionals are giving this information to their students because that’s “just the way it is.”\r\n\r\nIf you’re an arts educator still telling your students to list their weight on a resume, please reconsider. Weight looks different on everyone… and giving this number out to casting directors and creatives can be more hurtful than you think.\r\n\r\nIf you’re an actor, take your weight off your resume and take BACK your power.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'auditioning', '2021-01-07 18:49:00'),

Here are a few pointers to keep in mind when you are considering joining Actors’ Equity Association.', 'maggieEq.jpeg', 'Actors’ Equity Association (or AEA) currently represents over 51,000 stage managers and stage actors. Like any labor union, Equity’s job is to protect its’ members.\r\n\r\nFor years, there were 3 different ways an actor can be eligible to join AEA.\r\n\r\n1) By virtue of employment (receiving an equity contract after booking a show)\r\n\r\n2) Through membership of a sister union (SAG-AFTRA, AGMA, and AGVA)\r\n\r\n3) Through the Equity Membership Candidate Program\r\n\r\nHowever, now Equity membership is now open to any stage manager or actor who has worked professionally in the United States.\r\n\r\nEvery labor union has its pros and cons.  Here are a few pointers to keep in mind when you are considering joining Actors’ Equity Association.\r\n\r\nPROS\r\n\r\n  * AEA negotiates your minimum salary\r\n\r\n  * AEA negotiates your hours and fair working conditions \r\n\r\n  * Supplemental worker’s compensation during injury\r\n\r\n  * Health coverage (especially important after you turn 26 and can no longer use your parents’ health insurance)\r\n\r\n  * Pension/401K (if you ever plan on eventually retiring)\r\n\r\n  * Guaranteed Paycheck: Equity requires most producers to post a bond to ensure payment; even if a show closes or a producer defaults, you still get paid and won’t get stranded.\r\n\r\n  * Audition Access: Equity has negotiated required auditions including Equity Principal Auditions and Equity Chorus Calls. More than 1,300 audition notices are posted on Equity’s website annually.\r\n\r\n  * Endless union discounts on rehearsal studios, spas, gyms, hotels, restaurants, travel, etc.\r\n\r\nCONS\r\n\r\n  * AEA actors are limited to performing in Equity shows only, you can’t take non-union job offers\r\n\r\n  * Sometimes less opportunities for work equity actors than non-union actors\r\n\r\n  * Heavier competition\r\n\r\n  * Hefty initiation fee ($1,700 paid within a maximum two-year period. While working on contract, deductions will be made based on your weekly salary.)\r\n\r\n  * You must pay basic dues  ($176 annually, billed at $88 twice a year each May and November)\r\n\r\n  * Working dues are taken out of your contract (2.5% of gross earnings under Equity contract, which are collected through weekly payroll deductions)\r\n\r\n  * As a union member, you cost the producer more to hire because they pay into your larger union salary, pension and health insurance.', 'equity', '2021-07-21 14:16:00'),
('The 3 Social Media Platforms All Actors Should Try', 'Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, Clubhouse… which social media platforms should actors be on these days?', 'socialMedia.png', 'Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, Clubhouse… which social media platforms should actors be on these days?\n\nThe truth is, an actor doesn’t have to have any social media account to be successful. Take Jessie Mueller, Tony-nominee and star of Waitress and Beautiful: The Carole King Musical. She is totally off the grid when it comes to social media… not a crumb can be found online. Yet, she’s wildly successful.\n\nBut can social media help you on your journey?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAnd I, personally, can testify to this.\n\nSome of my favorite projects I’ve ever worked on came from connections I made online. In fact, the last recording I did was because of an Instagram DM. A literal direct message… and the rest is history!\n\nToday, we’re discussing all things social media for actors: and the best platforms you should try today!\n\n1. INSTAGRAM\n\nInstagram is one of the best free resources an actor can use. Not only can you post beautiful photos to your feed, but you can also use features like Stories and Reels to show off your authentic self. Just be sure everything you share aligns with who you are!\n\nI’ve made a handful of meaningful connections on the platform, from friendships within the industry to actual job opportunities.\n\n2. YOUTUBE\n\nThe next platform I believe every actor should be on is YouTube. It’s not about how many subscribers you may have, or how frequently you upload a video - it’s all about the quality of content you’re providing.\n\nDo you have up-to-date videos to share on YouTube? Or is the last thing you posted from 7 years ago when you starred in your high school show? Might be time to replace that with some new content. Share your latest song covers, your reels, whatever you do best.\n\n3. TIKTOK\n\nIf you’re looking to expand your reach online, TikTok is the way to go. By keeping videos short and getting creative with what you do best, you will find TikTok to be easier to grow through than any other platform.\n\nWhat exactly should you be sharing on TikTok? Find your niche, and get to it. Start by working with make the most of viral challenges, trends and popular songs… and experiment with the type of content you like to produce. Then, get specific. Write comedy? Perform your sketches. Write music? Perform your original songs. Love fashion? Show off your best outfits. Have fun, and don’t think too much! The casual nature of the app is what makes it so enticing. ', 'lifestyle', '2021-12-07 15:24:09');
