<html><p>You were listening to the actor aesthetic podcast episode 134 featuring special guest my sister and star taylor lee barrett let's get started. 
Okay y'all i have a confession to make i have been wanting to do this episode since i began this podcast back in november of 2018 today i'm so excited to bring you a conversation with my younger sister taylor sarah from a young age both my sister and i began pursuing the theater industry professionally in new york city and so we both had a pretty early start to beginning our professional careers taylor made her national tour debut understudy and kerry and eventually taking over the role of carrie and little house on the prairie the musical alongside the legendary melissa gilbert originated the role of laura in the little house on the prairie tv series she also originated the lead role of vita and helen on 86th street the musical which had a short run off broadway in new york city in 2020 during the pandemic she graduated with a b and musical theater from montclair state university in this episode i chat with taylor about growing up in the professional theatre industry touring the country at age 11 originating the lead and a brand-new musical in new york city college senior showcase and how she pivoted during the pandemic and heads-up she's like ways smarter cooler than me so you're welcome without further ado please sit back relax and enjoy our chat. 
So here's the thing i didn't prep any questions whatsoever. 
But i have a feeling that that's okay given that i do live right next to you kind of made my heart drop a little. do you remember like the age you were when you did your very first like theatrical production was it an e t i think that was probably when i was like 7. 
That's a call-out i couldn't read and i just saying the same verse over and over again because that probably was my first audition and i didn't know i didn't know what to do so i just kept involved like dance belly dancing at like 3 or 4 so i was doing competition dance so i was on stage and that was comfy but i've never sang like. 
You made it to the professional theater world quite quickly i think it was because of. 
Just my lack of awareness and just just need for a good time that it was. 
Sure alright like if i was good at it i was going to do it it was that kind of adrenaline rush process for the little house of the prairie so for those of you who don't know taylor was in the musical rendition of the little house on the prairie it went on a national tour and she started the production at papermill playhouse which was pretty incredible given that we live so close there you've done a lot of things there in the past and then she went out on tour for 9 with a 9 months yeah it was i think 6 months of actual touring but we did a month of rehearsal and then two months at papermill. 
The rehearsal process okay so really literally let's just let's just acknowledge the fact that you were in fact 10. 
10 years old so before you went on that audition process had we had started had we started to like actually like audition for professional productions in new york before that. 
I think we could probably been doing it for like a year or something that year so so you had a little bit of a background in professional on this. 
Kid productions are going on at the time or they didn't even realize we were a little bit naive oh yeah that's what i mean. 
No one in our family really new with you. 
Now judging us are stupid ass and being like you guys are booked in anything they're like oh my god that movie that you waited for an audition for is now playing at the local theater like you're very very first edition for little house 9 years old. 
And i was like i was like oh let me ask my grandpa outside if i can if that's okay and they were like oh no that's fine let's just go ask him and just let him know that we want you to come back later whatever. 
So i think that happened i did really well just cuz i was a dancer at the time and then i guess i got another call back where i met the director the producers like everybody like the music directors. 
And i sang for them i said what's your for the boy i think i again cuz there's a call back i think i forgot the words actually i don't think i forgot the words i know i forgot i did forget the words it's just it was it that song and i think it was. 
So i forgot the word cuz they actually asked me to take my glasses off. 
When i walked in the audition through so just so you know taylor up until she was 21 right when did you have your lasik surgery. 
That is a testament to your work ethic so because you did them right now is that like i couldn't see so i was just holding the paper for like like i was holding. 
I do not doubt my dilator i think so i think i found out pretty quickly after and then it was like. 
Another year couple months until the rehearsal started yeah but i think it was kind of just like a phone call that was like you booked and i called everybody of course and the understudy for carrie which was like the youngest daughter so did you know what that meant at 10 years old going into the process and go on for it. 
Like i'm completely saying like being that you was my strongest suit in this whole thing is i like. 
With always learning your tracks and stuff when you were doing them in your productions just because like i kind of had this weird. 
Probably just because like being in so many classes and learning so many things at the same time i agree that it might run a dance troupe so you were learning quite a few people who grew up with a really solid dance training. 
You're always like. 
Learning something new when you have to be a dad covenant. 
And and learning i like adding onto the old things that i don't know it's just kind of open to it was the people that you went on the store with so you book the role and you start rehearsals and you realize that these people are no joke these are kids that had either just graduated from italy top musical theatre programs in the country or were names already in the theatre industry one of them being kara lindsay and her husband kevin massey and you are also there with steve blanchard and meredith inglesby and of course. 
Melissa gilbert who was the o.g. laura ingalls in little house on the prairie the tv show. 
Yeah which is iconic i know it was like everybody's favorite tv show from like our parents will generations so that was you. remember the first rehearsal that we have you walked into my dad goes that's melissa gilbert over there and i was like. 
A schedule rude i was like a witch was also she just kind of blended in like it was already just no one was a star no one was this big broadway actor they were just you know doing their job going to rehearsal so everybody keep asking me why i know these people and performances and also because. 
So that was. 
6 hour days of just rehearsing but that was for a month and then we started school at papermill which ended up being had to go early and do like 45 hours of school and we will get ready and then we would do the show which. 
I mean it was the same amount of time you'll be at school during the day was kind of funny because there was only three of us yeah yeah so there's only three of us doing your school work. 
Internet being pretty easy because of that because we had such accessibility to like our teacher awesome. 
Which i really benefited from like. 
Getting to work on my own time and whatever i was feeling that day i kind of got to do which it's spoiled be a little bit because i'm back to school all day but. 
It was 45 hours of school a day we'll get time for dinner and then we going to the show. 
Now you go on the tour you spend nine months performing several of those months you actually took over for the lead for carry so your track change things changed and for the majority of the tour because she was still a child literally 11 years old you had to be on the tour with a parent or guardian so for the majority of the tour you had both your grandparents on the tour with you and then for a little bit you had my dad and then for a little bit you had it was mom also on tour with you at some point. 
They left and i did it for like a few weeks and then mom came for a few weeks and i was grandpa for the rest of the run and like that. 
I think she had yeah i think he had way more fun than anybody else involved with the entire aspect of the tour with grandparents is that because they were already retired they were taking us to and from these auditions like it was no one's business and they never ever complained. 
It's it was now what's how long is it been since about ten years or so a lot of our lives your life my life even seeing these people like i think one of the reasons why i ended up going to know i know one of the reasons why i ended up going to college for musical theater was because i saw the people who i looked up to you and your show like kara and and kate loprest and alessa niku it all gone to these incredible fear the article programs and i was like let's do this and it was one of our many auditions that we went on after you came home from your tour and. 
Droid so what was really neat though for you taylor was that you created this this whole roll i mean you were the stars of the show yeah they it was kind of crazy having like songs. 
Almost ready for me or like if i was really struggling with the part there like do it feels comfortable for you like there was so much flexibility and like so much room for creativity that. 
It was like such a safe space almost that it wasn't nerve-wracking or anything because. 
Anything that i did honestly became the character like there was so much of me that ended up being in that role because we've done it for so long that it was so comfortable and a crazy experience moving on now to college so here we go i had already gone to college for musical theater i had already been there for now i guess two years since before you started auditions right cuz. 
Yeah so you was there any doubt in your mind that you wanted to go to school from his computer. 
No you just always knew that. 
I was interested in other things but i knew that first and foremost yeah i know but i knew first and foremost that i was going to go for musical theater but i knew that i wanted to look into schools that would also offer me the opportunity to lie. 
Explore some other passions you know. 
That was big for me that's a good point like not going to a conservatory or doing any of that but that's really important is to think about before you even i'll just write programs cuz there were certain programs that are big or at least popular programs that you did not simply because you knew that if you had gotten and you still wouldn't have gone and it would have just been a waste of time for both. 
Say if i'm not going to actually go there if i get in like i don't want the safety schools yeah like. 
I'm just going to go to schools that i want to go to cuz i have to go for musical theater right. 
Which leads me to see you end up going to montclair state university you got a bfa musical theater and you graduated in the pandemic tell me about your senior year. 
Because it's wild it was trying to think back to first semester i just think of semesters by shows that you do. 
First semester then was i did here intact yes so that was like my final semester of like college kind of because then my second semester senior year was like flipped to the transition to the real world. 
And a college so i did here in town which is no fun. 
It was so funny because i didn't have to worry about so much schoolwork they set us up in montclair really well to have true pretty much all of our classes bombarding us freshman and sophomore year. 
You really have the ability to start your career much earlier than a lot of kids do when they go to school outside i was really anti going to school in new jersey just because we're funny jersey and i was like i want but i was like i got into montclair and i started thinking about like. 
How easy would you want to just go into the city and that you saw go and see these shows all together like the shakespearean shows that like i would never. 
Like either active or like still going in and. 
Had such a relationship with the city still which was awesome and your senior year so you end up doing here in town and you play little sally and then shortly after that you were a part of a production again a very brand new production that was staged at montclair which i'd say was one of the best pieces of theater even though it was barely theater because it was still like a state like a reading almost one of the best pieces of theater i've ever seen and it was the oldenburg sweet and i hope that after you listen to this i need you to go and search it up on spotify reddits on spotify is it all sewn up and there's always something that you want to change or do different when it comes to your senior showcase because you learn so much about yourself after you graduate college. 
Like i was trying to fix so many things within myself but also like it's basically a lot of musical theatre programs have this where they they they do a showcase either in new york city or at the show tour at the actual university that you attend where you can invite industry professionals casting directors directors people in the theatre industry that are the movers and shakers of this business and you're basically presenting your skills to be assessed by these people and by agents as well and and i ask this because i think you're that overall your showcase was amazing and i think we'll never be less than that because at your school is so great and your class was so good that your class was so good to change or something. 
My comes to the showcase showcase i just struggled a lot with. 
Like knowing who i was and like knowing what i wanted other people to see and like the line between that so like i was wearing clothes that i wanted to wear and i was looking the way that i wanted to wear but it wasn't doing material necessarily that was. 
Mirroring that and i was doing material that was mirroring this type that i was going to be which was great which was really helpful for me but i wish that i had found more of. 
More material that would have fit me as a person and not necessarily spoon-feeding a passenger i know what that's so true i think that just has like. 
I think overall we do have to trust our our professors and our mentors but ultimately you know you better than anyone else and you know what you want to be in a league also know like the songs that i was feeling comfortable singing in the songs that i was singing because. 
I would have trusted myself more put more confidence into like what i wanted to do what i wanted other people to be proud of me for doing. 
And that is that never that that is always apparent as you continue to audition professionally and material every single day that you had to shin has to be a matter of what you want to do versus what you think people want to see and it's so cliche but until after showcase to understand like what the process going into graduation and beyond once you once we hit the pandemic and where did you see yourself going from. 
Well our showcase was like literally the day that everything shut down march 10th so i think everything shut down like the 13th so right from there like we didn't have too much response right at least i didn't get too much because. 
It was like there were people that cancel that didn't come or you couldn't get the city to have these meetings with people so like i ended up having one agent meeting and it went really well and like. 
Everything that's happening right now. 
Get an agent and i can't continue to work that way but like if there's no work is going up right now to do also i would come out of college so like down and out about theater i was just leg did not have a good relationship with it at the time that i kind of took my ssi opportunity to like. 
Step back which i'm really grateful that i did because now i like. 
Mrs. i was reading on actors access that anastasia was having a distance to her what you did i had i read that all i read anastasia was having auditions but then i read it was non-union and as you know by now taylor is a union member cuz they're tour with union application fee. 
I really just should have taken the time to figure myself out and not. 
Only one of them by myself with school like if i follow the rules because at this point you would move back home yeah and all of my classes were going to be online so i was like android no travel time and your class. 
Like doing their own thing yeah everybody seems like they found their way to handle the pandemic still auditioning through videos or waitress and being a teacher or. 
Bing lounge singer you know like these ways that you wouldn't expect to be able to go on and up. 
I just think that's i think that's so neat so now i can do most out of it so now you are literally in the heart of working on this degree. 
And i'm force be with you i'm trying to find ways not allowed to put the two and put the two together because it's at some point i'm going to have to stop going to school and i'm going to have to get a job that. 
Just a job to play with kids and it helps me get a sharper mind and keeps me active so my last question for you is if you could give a piece of advice to someone who is young who's entering this career. 
Because we do have quite a few people who are young yeah who want to pursue this professionally. 
What would you say. 
I say that. 
It's not as big of a deal as you think it is. 
Yeah like. 
The world will keep turning. 
Like i know what you mean you know like don't put so much pressure on yourself. 
Yeah like especially if you're a kid like exactly like you can do this for fun this doesn't need to be your job like take it seriously and do it because you're passionate about it not because you need to do it for a living like enjoy it while you can for sure exactly and i think that was one of the best the best lessons we learned over our time pursuing the professional at a young age because the pressure wasn't on to book there's a different pressure that comes when you are out of college and you're you're having to pay for yourself to go through life with a different pressure that comes with booking a job but when you're a kid there's there is no pressure you don't need to be working we had to go through labor laws okay like you don't even need to be working so so you're absolutely right they do it because you're passionate about it because you want to work and you want to be the best and you want to be doing. 
What you can enjoy while you can. 
I love this i'm so glad that we did this i'm glad that i didn't prep i'd be a little nervous i'm a little nervous.
