That i could get that harmony right you know what i mean i love him to death he is so awesome what incredible collaborator and i've had the privilege of getting to collaborate with him over the past year or so during the pandemic on 1 million as well as boy a new musical and as someone who is frequently on the other side of the table he's got a lot of really great insight for us as performers so i am thrilled for this episode i hope you are too i really hope you enjoy this one i think you'll get a lot out of it without further ado enough from me sit back relax and enjoy our chat are you how are you haven't quite caught up to the back door back to work yet in your life but you got to do it up with you know what is happening in covid land and that kind of thing but yeah it's it's i don't know like it is different but like it feels so safe and i appreciate that everyone is being so cool about it because it really does. 
I don't know it does make it feel like hey we're like it is kind of like being back to normal with just some adjustment. 
You got this offer tell me about the the time where you actually found out you got the offer for pretty woman because that have to had to have happened somewhere right after you got done with book of mormon write about the position starting in january of 2020. 
And then i got the actual phone call that i was hired on march 13th of 2020 as i was in the ahmanson theater in la packing up book of mormon because we had just shut down due to covid and we thought we were everywhere we all fought like you know okay it'll be. 
Obviously that wasn't the case so that door was closed permanently but then it was kind of this weird thing where it's like you know i've i've known for 18 months like you know well i have a job i just don't know when i'm have a job but like it was it was kind of like from me i i considered i consider myself very very lucky because you know going through that whole very uncertain time where our whole entire industry was quite literally shut down and we had no idea when it would return how it return all that stuff it was nice to know that i had something down the line even if i didn't know when that was going to be but yeah it was crazy so like i've known. 
Use your creative energy and built basically 1 million musicals so i in september of 2020 so we were already well into the pandemic i got a text from jacob inch noel who was one of my mormon castmates and he said my riding partner and i have this crazy idea for a musical podcast series we're basically we will do a musical every month from scratch and i am also a crazy person and i'm pretty sure that's why jacob texted me and he's like. 
Some of the things i did with dino train shows as a music director because i would do you know zoom recording sessions with many actress such as yourself and you know so i kind of was using those you know skills but it also allowed me to like. 
Delve back into another skill set that i hadn't really had like the consecrated time to work with in awhile which was my like mike composing and orchestrating in the end that kind of stuff and then also just the chance to learn a whole bunch of like music technology that producing aspects that i just at my fingertips but i've never really been very grateful for it because it was just like an amazing way to to meet you artists and work on you know art and feel like we were doing something in the middle of a time we're literally are normal for the art was not possible north or south on highway 95 unless you were headed to the space center is still a little town that you would look at and go look and keep driving.. 
You know it's really fascinating i think my entire family kind of wondered where the music teams came from my mom and dad actually have good singing voices i don't know that they would say that but they do like to have to pitch and i my dad sort of like dabbled in guitar he never really learned it. 
All of the above yeah like you has ever going to answer all the about no i mean it's interesting because i feel like i don't really know how to describe it i feel like there are so many different sides to the music world there are so many different sides to the theater world and i feel like. 
You know each aspect of the things that i'm capable over the things that i've learned how to do i enjoy for different reasons they all bring me joy and different ways so you know i've had people ask like you know what do you love most about doing theater in for me outside of working with incredible performers if it's the ability to bring joy to an audience every night and to bring other people sort of like the ability to escape the real world for a little while and like lose themselves and something else because i know that's such an important thing for us to be able to and it can be very healing so i know from me the joy the biggest joy of theater is getting to like either spread that joy to other people which you know which why i like working on a tour for the tour book of mormon for so long was amazing because it's this funny hysterical. 
Creation. 
What would you say likes you up when you work with an actor or an actress or anyone in the theater industry what really like makes you think. 
You know this is this is a really great collaboration or this is a really great collaborator. 
I think it's the ability to. 
Hate information or take something and. 
Elevated to a different place whether that's. 
By making a choice that no one else has made if it's like previously existing material or by you know just being open to the possibility of going hey what if we did it this way instead of that way i see a lot to younger folks who are going to like tribes who are hoping to be in the industry is one of the things i say is most important flexibility to whatever and be open to possibilities beyond whatever your mind initially sort of goes oh this thing you know and to be able to think outside the box you know one of my one of my best friends in the whole world her name is bree jackson and we met on book of mormon and we have entirely too much fun working together and part of the reason is because either one of us can come to the other and say hey i have this crazy idea. 
Okay show me what you're thinking and then like we just do it and then usually it becomes this sort of stacking game as like school but what if we did this oh yeah we can do that and then do this and it just kind of like snowballs on itself until we come up with this crazy idea that somehow works. 
Honestly the biggest thing is being very clear about what your cut is like understanding i want you to start here i want you to start here i need a pitch i don't need a pitch and honestly the biggest one is tempo knowing what your tempo is because the thing is if you want it to be different than what they're used to or if you want to be the same as what they're used to just being able to to literally come up to them and say this is what temple i want and i usually tell people rather than like snapping the tempo at them or like tapping the tempo i literally will usually ask singers like i'll say hey sing like just like hum for me the first couple of bars so i can hear what you're thinking and don't feel bad about taking a second to do that because the clearer things are for that pianist the better you're going to feel about the song you're singing because there's less of a chance they're going to screw you up. 
I think the biggest thing is just being as genuine as you can don't come in there with the mindset of i have to impress these people come in there with the mindset of i am here to show you my take on xyz or to show you who i am as a performer the more genuine you are the better it plays because even if they're not even if they don't go over this person's going to get this role they might think of you later for another role because yes performance ability is important but also being a human being a human and a and like i personable human at that is is also important because people actually have to work with you and i think that kind of. 
Kind of just acts dismissive of me even if i'm not the music director might you've already lost me cuz it's like wow the audition is about you you need to be able to collaborate with this person and how you treat this person tells me a lot about who you are so like if you act like the edition penises banette you ended honestly that goes for even the people signing you into the audition if you walk into any part of an audition and you are treating the people behind any table as if they are somehow lesser than you. 
You're not going to make very many friends very quickly. 
Yeah well said well said is there anything that you wish that you could tell your younger self maybe you know. 
I would say i don't know maybe like 18 year old daniel has something that you wish you could tell yourself yeah. 
I think in regards to i mean there are so many things i would tell him but i think in regards to like career. 
Be open. 
And don't and don't be afraid to find a different path than the one you think you're going to come. 
I mean my 18 year old self and maybe possibly almost every aspect is very different than who i am now as a human as a performer as a everything and i'm a very different human these days and i'm actually very okay with that but you know when i was 18 getting ready for college like now. 
I haven't given up on that dream it's just so you know it's going to happen but you know it's interesting i always tell people i stumbled and fell in the theater and i liked it so much i stayed which is really true i love until i was eighteen i didn't really know a lot of theater and i had never thought of it as a possibility for a career and so it just kind of happened without me expecting it but so much of my life did not go the way that i expected and for the better you know so i'm always telling people like my biggest piece of advice to most people is as long as you are moving in a direction. 
You're doing good. 
But make sure that you're always moving in a direction. 
Whichever direction you're moving and you can change you have the power to change which direction you're moving in so if things aren't going exactly as you want them to or you realize something isn't for you there's no harm no foul no shame in being like you know what we're going that way instead but keep moving in a direction because the only danger in life is sitting still. 
Not that that is so real so real i needed a moment of silence for that one never would have even really have the time to start thinking about while i was on the road and so now i'm grateful that i have these projects touring cuz they're a part of what i'm doing using supervising a brand new musical it's called a writing partner of his matthew hornbeck and john approached me look at trying to push it forward and we want it so i'm still doing that but we started so i've kind of been there some of them are similar but they really exciting but i think it's really really great and. 
I mean right now it's like what's next for the show and so we're really actively like fundraising and trying to get things together to a concept album and our hope is like around the first part of next year were actually hoping to do like an in-person reads things through us the whole thing yeah so it's it's you know hopefully hopefully it'll be on broadway in the future. 
Worth it. 
Sure question. 
I think my biggest thing is to. 
I mean i sort of already said part of it always be moving in a direction you know and i think i think this thing is not being talked about is you note for people who have been in the industry who maybe the last 18 months is kind of changed their perspective on it for just change their perspective on what they actually want to do with their lives there's no shame in changing directions if you if 18-month square eye-opening for you in a way that you are like you know what this isn't for me anymore that's okay and you know anybody who tries to shame you because of that. 
They're not important and that's not a voice you should be listening to but i think the biggest thing is just to continually drive yourself towards something that brings you joy. 
Because i i say this literally all the time i'm like if if you're in the business of making art creating art being a part of art whatever it is you know if it's not bringing you joy why are you doing it because at that point it's literally become just another job and yes there a course there are moments where it's very much feeling that right now with rehearsals were rehearsing 5:50 everyday i'm exhausted and i'm not the one having to dance so like i can only imagine how those folks but yeah i think the biggest thing is make sure that ultimately at the end of the day what you're doing is bringing you joy and if it's not. 
Find something that brings you joy whether that's theater whether it's singing you know what it may be that you're not like oh my gosh i want to leave theater but it might be like. 
Go through your audition book and be like i don't like these songs anymore and change them up you know find you music to sing find other ways of expressing yourself that bring you joy and then hang on to those things as long as they bring you julian when they don't bring you joy anymore move on to that next thing that brings you joy. 
Couldn't have said it any better couldn't have said it any better i really appreciate you i am so looking forward to singing with you but i am really looking forward to seeing you very soon.
