Checkerburger hey maggie hey what an intro tell us what you're up to these days yes giving st louis missouri. 
I'm playing joe pesci and covering frankie valli and then everytime frankie sings pretty much with the show i must also singing as his to get that doubling of which i did not know they did they do that in every production. 
Maybe. 
Are you going to second to breathe or frankie's track is very interesting just because. 
He's really not the lead of the first act it really is tommy devito show he's the one taking you through and then the second act is when we really go to frankie's life and what happened with his daughter and his marriage. 
You got to do more acting and just marcin work and it was less about the global gymnastics and first act and more about like now is get to the heart. 
Yeah we're here we're doing this through recovered through all of it. 
It's been a little different for sure. 
Well it's a very like reputable an established regional theater in the bestway like all the good parts of my community theater are also here like it is very family-oriented they do have their regulars that are locals that come back at are like amazing and like everyone expects to see in the shows so it's kind of a cool balance between. 
Those two worlds of like professional theater and like a family activity nice community theatre. 
While putting on like broadway caliber performances are frankie was the original in the first national tour are bob gaudio ride jesse was on broadway for a year as bob gaudio the other one or tommy was also like they're all. 
Very native to the show. 
But yet imagine was just one tape and then i didn't hear anything for a couple weeks and then my agent got back to me saying so there's some interest here i will let you know i was like okay. 
And part of that was i think i knew gail and scott cuz they kept me websites dorian2019 and and gail is the associate director for the show as what which is awesome yeah so is really like no her even better. 
The protocols would be an erection. they're not as like. 
I guess you found where you stop noticing them which is good when you get to just like be in rehearsal and get to just do the work in like you forget about the mask and everything and. 
Getting to this base and being aware of your surroundings and things like that. 
Yep so it just been. 
Pretty. 
Pretty easy to do but. 
If we're not ready. 
It to dive into the work like. 
Like which what should we eat. 
Is glorious week that we we had to do a show weeks. 
9 shows 9 showings like are you actually warming up or do you feel like you're in a position where you don't have to cuz you just singing all day everyday. 
But yeah the first day i was going home and like. 
Usually like the couple weeks of rehearsal is enough to build in the rollage my voice to wear then do like a crazy warm up i kind of check-in with certain things but i notice about correlation between good musicals and the ability to let your lead warm up with the show. 
Frankie doesn't have to come out and just like you all do the big 3 you know there there's like a nice progression to it so. 
Tension in places i've never had. 
Yeah of course like of course but this kind of get up to that all those crazy falsetto and coordination notes. 
So take me back to march of 2020 right when the pandemic actually hit what were you doing where were you what were you doing career-wise and also just like lifewise where you at. 
I was in new york my friend had just come in for the weekend cuz we're going to see some shows actually we had to take the night broadway shutdown we had tickets to company. 
And i was actually about two days. 
After the shutdown are supposed to go in rehearsal for a brand-new play called drift that was happening at new world stages off broadway and i was covering a lead in that it's like a five-person play it was the tree to like be commuting in new york to understudy rehearsals like nobody night was the week later it was going to be a big thing it was starring joe pantoliano emmy award winner from the sopranos directed by bobby moresco who like was involved. 
And that the whole process working with him just to get the part was a nap but i was very excited and then it was a big bummer once it was very clear. 
And then on a. 
On a whim to kind of appease the parents actually me and liliana my girlfriends parents were both from la they were like a couple weeks. 
We were still in l.a. so what are you thinking then moving forward like after the show and everything are you considering coming back to new york or do you like staying out in la. 
I really enjoyed laii i've been lucky enough to even during the pandemic and right before the pandemic i was in prodigal son on fox is a little co-star roll named leonard. 
But it's okay but then i was able. 
Probably like august 2020 there was a very small short film that was happening that. 
I applied for a backstage nothing obviously safely and they took all the precautions everything but i was like i feel comfortable enough to go do a small little project their projects. 
I did a tape for a show in. 
New york do so many new york a new apple tv show starring anne hathaway and jared leto each of them. 
Masked up isolated go to sat together matthew airlines put your mask back on leave like it was it was very different. 
Starting to really fall in love with the tv from world as well tv film being newer kind of exciting and acting in that medium. 
And. 
Yeah and i've kind of felt a little bit more to the writing world to roto short film that you've seen i was going to ask you about it but pause because i talked to me about like you know it's someone's listening right now and they don't have a lot of experience in the tv film world but they're coming from a theatrical background what would you say is the difference between an audition for a theater production versus a commercial or film or something on tv. 
I mean i think what the biggest difference is. 
4a. 
Tv film audition there still a camera there even in the optician job. 
You almost have to. 
Is that awkward calabria calibration of performing in a small space but this shows in a big theater so how do i show that i can fill a big theater while also not being annoying. 
And yeah it's that hundred percent technique hundred percent spontaneity like bob krakauer says and then they say. 
Essentially you can plan it out but then you can throw it that away and then just walk into the room and be whatever you want. 
Totally a lot of the stuff the entry-level of dome like co-star roles that are like under five lines are very reactionary characters anyway and and so being be diligent about about planning those. 
The smaller rolled gigs that are reactionary just like okay to they know how to behave on-screen versus a stage where you can kind of move more freely new user full body where is it the most part it's just like from your head to your shoulders eventually came to be. 
Dirty shot clean in collaboration with a production company that actually my dad has created and that i've kind of worked with him on we only produce merrily we roll along. 
I was driving around actually there was this of all places is church in la which is but it literally him in like not the nicest la. 
So i drive by like 2 in the morning sometimes and there be like one person sitting inside. 
Rosa vinny kind of bait that book that was just intriguing to me like one person what why would they be there at this hour of the day it's pitch-black all around there's a little light from his church and one person sitting in their lives. 
And finding this kind of hope or what looks to be a potential way out or saving grace in an unexpected place and yeah so we made that. 
We did that thing it was awesome we still didn't 2 days to like full 12-hour like long amazing grady in the trenches days which is so fun. 
But also it is a certain project since like you are in the trenches and it it's not as much weight as it is like. 
Let's we got to get in there get everything and get out so the fox network. 
Guerilla-style filmmaking where you're just getting in getting out we're up against the clock we have one day to do this we don't get it all we don't we have to figure out a net it you know. 
Which is really really excited the most artistically fulfilled i probably ever been. 
Okay you know that any different faction it is it is it feels like i've. 
A little pig in the. 
Journey of me as a rider which is really cool middle school to collaborate with friends and it was very in-house which is awesome. 
Complicated subject matter which is really really that's awesome i'm excited to see where that one goes cuz it's awesome. 
That was the starting point but it's different i'm just very open to anything right now. 
They've been very open to me being out in la. 
And it's a roller coaster of ups and downs in new york for sure la feels a little more. 
Because i i know la more than your calves still getting to know you new york at this moment and also if i'm gearing towards tv film like la i think i want to be in. 
But doing theater again is conflict and kind of multiple directions for sure but it's good it's all good. 
Not polled do not think i'm being told in a new direction but i think i like about this tell me about the mindset behind and then and then what those meetings were like with it with your age. 
Showcase was an interesting thing my my package pacifically of songs. 
With changing up until like the week before anyone doesn't know showcase meaning like senior showcase like you get out of your your senior year of college if you're doing like a bfa musical theatre lots of times people have a showcase but. 
Yeah mine was changing up until like. 
The last possible second was just kind of funny. 
We have an agent come see it early and they give some feedback and. 
Three songs one of which. 
Liquor store. 
And so they suggested either hot one or change one because i'm getting the same information. 
Every single day from harmony by barry manilow i had that and then i was also doing everybody's talkin which is kind of interesting. 
We ended up cutting every single day and then i replace that with barrett song little bit more of a kind of like from the love side of things. 
Anna. and i was super open to that cuz i love that song and yeah so we we added that song and then i call it my package was fine because i ended up cutting my monologue. 
Then i was kind of deciding between and then. 
What's funny is i thought i had decided on one agent that i had a meeting and i really thought they were awesome and. 
And then i end up having a follow-up meeting with agent that i have now which is hckr which is formally harding hurt associates i had a follow-up meeting with. 
And in that meeting specifically things changed and these are kind of. 
I think these are my people. 
And then also with the guidance of rachel hoffman who helped produce our showcase then was down to these talk to and then i messaged her and was like. 
Humble as you know we we did our mock agent meetings were pretty accurate to be honest like wanting to know what shows i see myself in right now on broadway what's currently running. 
And i feel like i'm fairly decent at just being myself and not trying to put on anything and then what was really helpful with they didn't ask but i was like i want to make this point to tell them is that cuz i have been. 
During college i had been taping for darren hansen many many many many times for various roles things like that and that was the most valuable information that i gave them which which was jessica. 
A ninja that i knew that was in that like and i had to put the door there and i could just kind of see them that that's really good to know right. 
I think i want to get a sense of. 
How much actually do things i didn't know yet which bfa really helped prepare us for i think. 
And then yeah and then also there were other people that interview with them that they didn't offer signing to like it and just because it didn't work out. 
Without knowing for sure yet if they were even wanting to work with me i was like i would love to work with them and then iqor spotted a little bit more on each other. 
It's kind of crazy that has been like 4 years that's crazy. 
And then it would be either it's been like a really nice surprise because there have been things i've had to turn down that maybe they were would have wanted me to audition for but there was never any kind of animosity or any kind of like. 
Sustainable. 
And get ready for me to do here okay. 
It was really cool i met. 
This guy michael mastro when i did west side story who was our associate director and could been with my agent for like the past 20 years. 
Them and like hearing his insights was superhealth what you're trying to say if you want to tell me about west side story and i want to know all about it because absolutely incredible and how long were you in that production to i mean this is before the pandemic. 
If anyone wants any wild photos of maggie just message me. 
Just kidding he was just saying the saints of newark. 
Yeah that was 2019 that would have been in like that was like a long process couple months few months casting process. 
Again i will have is in a chipotle and i got the audition i was like what i was like i just got out of that school is in japan that's cool. 
You have japanese local television they were filming a documentary as well. 
And david stain and there was a casting director on the 2009 revival like. 
Toll-like. 
Air of all that he got all like he was literally like his protege. 
He just worked a spielberg on the movie as like a lead producer consultant. 
And so whenever that. 
I went in and the first thing he said actually would you remind me of a young jeremy jordan. 
And then. 
I don't think they were having callbacks for like another three weeks to a month just cuz they were doing seeing everyone else for everything else. 
I was like i was like i literally literally so don't screw it up. 
So yeah and then i did a call back. 
And i was we were paired with maria's and i was paired with the beautiful sonia balsara who actually ended up getting it for a long time we left. 
And then we were there again all day going in and out. 
Partnered with different people and then it was down to us and another couple people then they let those other people go and they just had us and then. 
North face. 
You for one more thing it's all like we walked in. 
We walked inside and the director was like i just want to tell you guys that you guys have been chosen to be tony and maria and which is really awesome ended lily pretty sure she was there and some other people on the production team and they filled our reaction or whatever the together this whole like. 
Reality show looking documentary series that they are in japan and then yeah so then. 
Theater called a stage around and seats it's like a big house that sits on a turntable. 
That dan rotates throughout the show as action dictated but yeah we were there it was designed by anna louise those two santoni award-winning designer lighting design by ken billington. 
But because this was actually non-union because in japan. 
Dream experiences to play tony in west side story music in this. 
I know space never once we have a technical difficulty and i wants to be at the whole parade thing it was the most. 
Nn japan it i want to go back tomorrow i just want to know like why you just continue to play all of these. 
Beato and then like four. 
Tonight we were on our balcony you know as you are usually in that scene and then all the sudden recovery like siri. 
Extending over the audience. 
I told the audience at walder like literally yes it was insane and in like. 
Just one of my first jobs which was like really really cool. 
And a lot to gal got a receipt for continued jobs. 
I don't know them for them you know they're like so supportive my last question for you trevor is 18 year old trevor okay so before you even go to like college like before you do anything right. 
What would you if you could go back what would you tell him what's like what's like your biggest piece of advice that you feel like you'd be back until. 
As pushy as it is i think it said. 
Take a breath you'll end up where you end up and that's going to be okay you know because i went into the whole college admission process. 
Nervous but having all these like preconceived ideas michael dishes at tops. 
And this is what i'm going to be doing cuz that's what we are used to it now. 
But yeah i want to go to michigan i did not like texting with the last place i understand for i bet it was the first place i heard back from that it on campus which. 
If you're going to try to go on campus i think just a really really amazing experience and. 
During that whole audition day on campus my whole perspective shifted.
