  Within the theatre community, there is always someone looking to learn. From inexperienced to professional, performers are constantly in class, teaching class, 
and studying. However, taking classes is inaccessible to those who live outside of New York City. Even in a place that encourages the arts, it can be impossible 
to find appropriate teachers. 
  
  This mobile resource includes information on NYC auditions, the actors union, budgeting as a performer, and many more tips and stories from working actors. Additionally, it will be a place for networking, discussions, and safe space for any performer who needs a community. 
The system will allow the client to publish their content, so it is imperative that the administrative tasks are easy to perform in-browser by a non-technical user of this system. As a result, the system includes an in-browser CMS(Content Management System) accessible only to users in administrative roles. Within this administrative system, additional to the capability to create content, will be analytics of website traffic, to ensure the most resourceful user experience. Here, the administrator can see which content is getting the most views and which aspects of this website need attention. 

In future developments, an account management system will be added to allow users to post, share, and interact with each other to build a community of actors.

ActorAesthetic.com is formatted using python, mysql, html, the flask framework and Bootstrap templates. It is still currently under development.

The database is currently not hosted through a secure and personal domian. For testing, it has been hosted by 'localhost.'
